# learnrobotics.io
Emscripten-based robotics simulator for learning robotics

## Milestones
1. Add static code for a basic HTML layout with Three.js
1. Merge Bullet libraries into this repository and create a simple btMultiBodyDynamicsWorld
1. Create a simple cube in three.js whose position is driven by a cubes position in Bullet and watch it fall under gravity
1. Investigate how the simulation can paused, moved backwards and forwards (keyframes)
1. Investigate adding audio to accompany a lesson
1. Investigate options for adding a code editor
